## Plan

1.  **Review and Refine:** Review the existing components for any inconsistencies or areas for improvement.
2.  **Add Images:** Add placeholder or actual images to the `Courses.vue` component and any other sections that require them.
3.  **Final Touches:** Make any final adjustments to styling, animations, and content to ensure a polished and professional look.
